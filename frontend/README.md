# Frontend

This project aims to manage the Starcitzen Clan's Fleet.
It can also serve as a model of angular projects.


# Development
For development, as the idea here is a sample of knowledge, this project has its own backend using Json-Server as a facilitator.

First, to start first you must turn on JSON Server with the command `npm run mock: server`.
Then turn on the `npm run mock` application. This profile will apply the environment settings to use JSON-SERVER as Backend.

Attention! For a definitive version, it is important to implement a resilient and secure Backend.
